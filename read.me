🖥️ Nano Processor (4-bit VHDL CPU)

This project is a custom-designed 4-bit Nano Processor built using VHDL.
It simulates the core functionalities of a basic CPU, executing arithmetic, bitwise, and control operations.

🚀 Key Features

Supports 4-bit operations with 8 general-purpose registers

Arithmetic instructions: ADD, NEG

Bitwise instructions: AND, OR, XOR, NOT

Program flow control: Conditional jumps (JZR)

Custom instruction decoder and program ROM

Seven Segment Display output for visualization
